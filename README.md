Hats off to the team at [JustWorks.ca, who originally created this list](https://justworks.ca/blog/ios-and). They stopped maintaining the list of iOS EAS user agents in early 2023, and I'm hoping to carry on with this documentation. 

>iOS devices unfortunately do not register with ActiveSync or other tools with a logical clear human readable version number. Instead, they show up with strings like "Apple-iPhone3C1/902.206"  
>Obviously, this makes discovery and reporting difficult.  To help ourselves, and the community at large, we now maintain this list of hardware and iOS versions for Apple gear.
